git and GitHub are not the same thing. Git is an open-source, version control tool created in 2005 by developers working 
on the Linux operating system; GitHub is a company founded in 2008 that makes tools which integrate with git. You do not 
need GitHub to use git, but you cannot use GitHub without using git. There are many other alternatives to GitHub, such as GitLab,
 BitBucket, and “host-your-own” solutions such as gogs and gittea. All of these are referred to in git-speak as “remotes”, 
and all are completely optional.
 You do not need to use a remote to use git, but it will make sharing your code with others easier.

What that "origin" word means -

What happens is that when you clone a remote repository to your local machine, 
git creates an alias for you. In nearly all cases this alias is called "origin." 
It's essentially shorthand for the remote repository's URL. 
So, to push your changes to the remote repository, 
you could've used either the command: git push git@github.com:git/git.git yourbranchname 
or git push origin yourbranchname

Create a pull request (PR)
A pull request (or PR) is a way to alert a repo's owners that you want to make some changes to their code. 
It allows them to review the code and make sure it looks good before putting your changes on the primary branch.
